    <h1>Trampoline</h1>
        <h2>By Shel Silverstein</h2>
        <p>Bouncin' upon the trampoline/so high above the ground./ Just as I was goin' up/ I saw her-- comin' down.</p>
        <p2>She had a daisy in her hair./ She wore a silken gown./ But when she started goin' up./ I was comin' down.</p2>
