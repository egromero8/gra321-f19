    <h1>Trampoline</h1>
        <h2>By Shel Silverstein</h2>
            <p>Bouncin' upon the trampoline<br/>So high above the ground.<br/>Just as I was goin' up<br/>I saw her-- comin' down.<br/></p>
    
            <p>She had a daisy in her hair.<br/>She wore a silken gown.<br/>But when she started goin' up.<br/>I was comin' down.<br/></p>
    
            <p>I tried to say, "Hello--nice day."<br/>She smiled and spun around.<br/>"Come up awhile with me," yelled she.<br/>But I was goin' down.<br/></p>
    
            <p>And so, as yet, we've never met<br/>Because we've sadly found<br/>That one is always goin' up<br/>While one is comin' down.<br/></p>
