    <h1>Trampoline</h1>
        <h2>By Shel Silverstein</h2>
            <p1>Bouncin' upon the trampoline/So high above the ground./Just as I was goin' up/I saw her-- comin' down.</p1>
            <p2>She had a daisy in her hair./ She wore a silken gown./But when she started goin' up./ I was comin' down.</p2>
            <p3>I tried to say, "Hello--nice day."/She smiled and spun around./"Come up awhile with me," yelled she./But I was goin' down.</p3>
            <p4>And so, as yet, we've never met/Because we've sadly found/That one is always goin' up/While one is comin' down.</p4>
